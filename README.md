# ðŸ“† Weather App Demo - Next.js 11 + React 17 + Tailwind CSS

# âœ… Code Repaired by Dr. Derek Austin to Work and Match Design

# ðŸ‘€ View Production Build at https://weather-app-demo.vercel.app

I repaired [this weather app](https://codesandbox.io/s/blazing-butterfly-6qudf) to actually work and match the design document.

Additionally, I added \_\_ other major features, including best practices and extensive test coverage.

Below you will find a complete feature set, discussion section, and technical journal.

## Required Features

1. âœ… Fix the bug where the app crashes when trying to request the weather

2. ðŸŸ© Refactor <CityWeather> to a function component using React Hooks

3. ðŸŸ© Match the design

   - A designer has provided a comp on how this app should look (see design.png)
     - To match the design you may need to use different fields that are retuned from teh openweathermap API. For example, the weather condition three digit code can be [mapped to the icons here](https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions)
   - Tailwindcss is installed and configured for you

4. ðŸŸ© Improve web accessibility

   - Ensure that clicking on the label "Weather Search" puts focus into the text-input.
   - Make sure any loading states are correctly announced to a screen reader

5. âœ… Make the tests better

## Additional Features

1. âœ… Deployed production build of Next.js to Vercel with CI/CD
2. âœ… Upgraded Next.js to `@latest` (`v11.1.2`) and all other dependencies
3. âœ… Established engineering best practices:
   - Prettier, ESLint, Husky (Git Hooks), `tsconfig.json`, TypeScript Import Sorter, `.gitattributes`
4. âœ… Crafted unit tests for new code features (TDD / Test Driven Development)
   - Jest + React Testing Library with React Test Renderer
5. ðŸŸ© Wrote unit testing for existing code (16% âž¡ 100% test coverage)
6. ðŸŸ© Developed mobile-first, responsive UX design with Tailwind CSS

## Discussion Section

1. ðŸŸ© Talk about your changes

   - Write a short description about what was the underlying cause of the bug and how you fixed it

2. ðŸŸ© Talk about your changes

   - For the refactor and other accompanying tasks, include any other thoughts, assumptions, or known compromises in how you approached the work.
